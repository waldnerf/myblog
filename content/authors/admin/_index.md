Dr. François (aka Franz) Waldner helps agricultural businesses and organisations build innovative digital products to map, monitor and forecast crop production anywhere, at any time, and at any scale. His approach leverages remote sensing, machine learning, and strong domain knowledge. Franz has completed a PhD at UCLouvain on large-scale yearly cropland mapping using high resolution satellite image time series. He then joined the CSIRO to develop the next generation of tools to identify crop types and estimate crop yields across the Australian continent. He is particularly interested in developing innovative techniques in line with the operational requirements of agricultural and land applications. Franz has also developed  strategies for monitoring locusts and grasshoppers habitats in Asia and Africa. In 2016, he won the Agriculture award of the Data For Development  challenge organised by Orange in collaboration with the MIT. He has authored 30+ scientific articles in international, peer-reviewed journals.
